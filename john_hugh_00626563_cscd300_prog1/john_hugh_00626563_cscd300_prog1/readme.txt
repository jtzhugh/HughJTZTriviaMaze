I could't get it to run through the command line, but I tested it in eclipse adding the arguments through configurations and it worked perfectly!

For the modified algorithm, I'm basically just running two separate binary searches, one that's set up to find x with either a smaller number or the end of the array to the left, and another to the right. This results in a timecost of just log n, as the two searches would be 2 log n but the leading constant falls away like everything else in the analysis.
